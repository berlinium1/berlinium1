                                <li><b>Image quality that’s better than your camera phone</b><br>
                                    By reading camera reviews, you should be able to make this decision. There’s no point in carrying around a camera if it doesn’t take a nicer looking image than your phone, or at least offer features that your phone does not.
                                </li>
                                <li><b>Ergonomics that suit your hands</b><br>
                                    If you’re unable to go to your local camera store to actually hold the camera, you’ll just have to make an educated decision based on the reviews you read. Is it big enough? Does it have a pronounced grip? Do the essential buttons look far enough apart?
                                </li>
                                <li><b>Size that suits your habits</b><br>
                                    This is an important one. Are you a parent that’s always got a child in tow? If so, your camera should probably be light and/or compact. Do you usually carry a bag around with you? You could get away with something larger. Do you travel a lot? etc etc
                                </li>
                                <li><b>Availability of lenses that suit your budget and future needs</b><br>
                                    If you choose a compact camera with a fixed lens, there’s no need to consider this. If you opt for an interchangeable lens camera, take a look at the other lenses on offer. Are they in your price range? Are there focal lengths you need? Are second hand lenses available?
                                </li>
                                <li><b>The latest model within your budget</b><br>
                                    With camera technology moving so fast, I always recommend investing in the latest cameras. If your budget can’t stretch to the absolute latest, there are often bargains to be found with a previous model, but try and avoid anything older than this. There’s also the option of second hand… but, caveat emptor!
